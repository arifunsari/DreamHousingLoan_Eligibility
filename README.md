# Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project automates the **loan eligibility process** for Dream Housing Finance, enabling real-time predictions based on customer details such as gender, marital status, dependents, income, credit history, and property area.  

## Project Highlights  
- **Objective**: Identify eligible customers for home loans by analyzing demographic and financial data.  
- **Data Processing**:  
  - Comprehensive **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** and data wrangling to prepare a clean dataset.  
  - Handled both categorical and continuous variables effectively for optimal ML model performance.  
- **ML Models Implemented**:  
  - Multiple algorithms were evaluated to ensure the best performance.  
  - **Accuracy Scores** for different models:  
    | ML Algorithm | Train Accuracy | CV Score | Test Accuracy |
    |--------------|----------------|----------|---------------|
    | Logistic Regression (LR) | 82%        | 82%      | 78%           |
    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 77%        | 74%      | 74%           |
    | Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 82%    | 82%      | 78%           |
    | Decision Tree (DT)          | 82%      | 82%      | 78%           |
    | Random Forest (RF)          | 99%      | 82%      | 77%           |
    | AdaBoost (AB)               | 83%      | 83%      | 76%           |
    | Gradient Boosting (GB)      | 87%      | 82%      | 73%           |
    | Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) | 85%   | 82%      | 77%           |  

  - **Decision Tree (DT)** was selected as the best model with consistent accuracy across train, CV, and test datasets, balancing accuracy (82%) and computational efficiency.  

## Tools and Techniques  
- Data preprocessing and visualization: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- Machine Learning: **Scikit-learn**  

## Key Takeaway  
This end-to-end project, developed from scratch, showcases the complete ML lifecycleâ€”starting from data exploration and preprocessing to evaluating multiple models and selecting the best one. It automates loan eligibility prediction effectively, helping streamline the decision-making process.
